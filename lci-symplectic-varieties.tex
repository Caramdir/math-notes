\maketitle

To apply the theory of singular support of coherent sheaves to symplectic varieties, one needs said varieties to be l.c.i.
In this case the varieties actually have singular locus of pure codimension~$2$ \cite[Corollary~1.5]{Fu:2006:SurveySymplectic}.
The doesn't seem to be a complete classification of such varieties, see~\cite[Problem~1]{Fu:2006:SurveySymplectic}.
However the only homogeneous complete intersections are nilpotent cones \cite{Namikawa:2013:HomogeneousSmplecticVarietiesOfCompleteIntersection}
