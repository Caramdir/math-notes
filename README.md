Some random notes about mathematics. 

These are just personal notes. **A lot of the stuff in this repository might not be correct.** Any errors in statements attributed to other people are probably misunderstandings on my part.

Bibliography references refer to caramdir/bibliography. LaTeX classes and packages to caramdir/latex-classes.
