\title{Lie algebroid modules}

\maketitle

Seeing Lie algebroids as a generalization of the tangent sheaf, one can see Lie algebroid modules (or modules over the universal enveloping algebra) as generalizations of $D$-modules.
In particular I am interested in modules for Hamiltonian functions on a symplectic variety (or more generally a Poisson variety).

Since Lie algebroid modules are the same as modules over the enveloping algebra, their derived category should exist and be decently well-behaved.

Let $σ\colon \sheaf A → \sheaf T_X$ be a Lie algebroid.

\begin{itemize}
    \item For proving stuff on singular varieties it would be useful to have coordinate-free proofs of basic properties of $D$-modules.
    \item If $\sheaf A$ is Hamiltonian vector fields on a singular symplectic variety, how do $\sheaf A$-modules compare to $D$-modules?
    \item Should $\sheaf A$ be coherent? Is the $\O_X$-module generated by Hamiltonian vector fields always coherent?
    \item What corresponds to $Ω_X = \bigwedge^n Ω¹_X$?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Should one take the complex $\Hom(\bigwedge^n \sheaf A, \O_X)$ (or some version of that)?
            \item Can we define it by a version of~\cite[Lemma~1.5.7]{HottaTakeuchiTanisaki:2008:DModulesPerverseSheavesRepresentationTheory}?
            \item It should have all the necessary properties to switch between right and left modules.
                In particular it needs to be an $\sheaf A$-module.
        \end{itemize}
    \item What are \enquote{integrable connections}, i.e.~coherent $\sheaf A$-modules?
    \item Do we get a version of Kashiwara equivalence?
    \item Is there a good duality functor?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item On \enquote{integrable connections} it should coincide with coherent duality (up to shift).
        \end{itemize}
    \item Is there a good theory of singular support?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Is there an analogue of involutivity, and does it hold?
            \item Hence, can one define \enquote{holonomic} $\sheaf A$-modules.
            \item (As a side question: Is it possible to see singular support for $D$-modules in a way similar to singular support for coherent sheaves~\cite{ArinkinGaitsgory:arXiv:SingularSupport}? What is the Hochschild cohomology of the category of $D$-modules?)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Can one translate regularity?
    \item Is there a version of the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What is the analogue of constructible sheaves?
            \item As a preparation: Compute the de Rham or solution complexes of some \enquote{simple} $\sheaf A$-modules.
        \end{itemize}
    \item How does all of that interact with desingularization (in particular in the case of a symplectic resolution)?
\end{itemize}
